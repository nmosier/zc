[ ] remove IdentifierExpr
[ ] finish TypeCheck() for all nodes
[ ] add annotation for expressions for whether `lvalue' or `rvalue'
[X] add "dereferencable" annotation to Decl
[ ] remove Identifier
[X] add "Address" method to decls
[X] add "integral" method to decl
[X] Least-upper bound of integer. Perhaps via integer sorting? 
[ ] when first line is error, root is NULL, causing segfault

PARSER
[ ] Handle nested pointers properly, e.g. *(*id) -> **id

SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
[X] `long long int` -> `LONG`, not `LONG_LONG`
[X] print annotated types
[X] type serialization for easy equality check
[X] Convert Decl to ASTType
[X] rewrite DeclSpecs to return TypeSpecs converted to single TypeSpec.
[X] Handle function to function pointer TypeCoercion edge cases.
[X] Don't add identifiers in function declarations that are not definitions to scope
[X] Introduce declarations as types
[ ] Return statements present unless void.
[ ] Type deserialization for easy type construction
[ ] Fix "incomplete type" error when declaring "void *"
[ ] Add explicit cast expressions whenever needed so that types always match.
[ ] Always cast down logical expressions to char.

AST
[X] Add bindings of types to identifiers (TypeID, perhaps?)
[ ] Transformations of AST at different stages
[X] Tagged Type (ASTTaggedType)
    - current ASTType becomes specialization of ASTTaggedType
    - ASTBoundType becomes ASTTaggedType<Symbol *>
[ ] Constructor type functions for converting Declarator to type
[X] Get rid of virtual on ASTNodeVec

ASM
[ ] Register attributes: loadable, movable, addable, etc.
[ ] Separate singleton classes for each register (`a', `hl', etc.)

CGEN

GENERAL
[ ] Add function calls.
[ ] Add fwd declaration headers.

CODEGEN
[ ] add `live()' method for blocks to determine if they can be joined.
[ ] better solution than `return register'
[ ] Move new_label() mechanism into cgen environment.
[ ] Add pass that converts transitions to instructions.
[ ] use std::deque for instructions in blocks.
[ ] abstract away instruction and transition access in blocks.
[ ] functions should have epilogue that `ret' transitions jump to
