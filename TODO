[ ] remove IdentifierExpr
[ ] finish TypeCheck() for all nodes
[ ] add annotation for expressions for whether `lvalue' or `rvalue'
[X] add "dereferencable" annotation to Decl
[ ] remove Identifier
[X] add "Address" method to decls
[X] add "integral" method to decl
[X] Least-upper bound of integer. Perhaps via integer sorting? 
[ ] when first line is error, root is NULL, causing segfault

PARSER
[ ] Handle nested pointers properly, e.g. *(*id) -> **id

SEMANTIC ANALYSIS
[ ] `long long int` -> `LONG`, not `LONG_LONG`
[ ] print annotated types
[ ] type serialization for easy equality check
[ ] Convert Decl to ASTType
[ ] rewrite DeclSpecs to return TypeSpecs converted to single TypeSpec.
[ ] Handle function to function pointer TypeCoercion edge cases.
[ ] Don't add identifiers in function declarations that are not definitions to scope
[ ] Introduce declarations as types

AST
[ ] Add bindings of types to identifiers (TypeID, perhaps?)
[ ] Transformations of AST at different stages
[ ] Tagged Type (ASTTaggedType)
    - current ASTType becomes specialization of ASTTaggedType
    - ASTBoundType becomes ASTTaggedType<Symbol *>
